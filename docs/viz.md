# SFO Transportation Analysis: Rideshare Usage Patterns (2016-2017)

## Project Overview
This document details the methodology of visualizing San Francisco International Airport (SFO) survey data, focusing on rideshare usage patterns across different demographic groups and time periods.

### Research Foci
1. Rideshare usage by income bracket
2. Rideshare usage by trip purpose (business vs. non-business)
3. Rideshare usage comparison between 2016 and 2017

## Visualizations

### Year-over-Year Rideshare Usage (Slopegraph)

**Design Choices:**
- I chose a slopegraph for the following reasons:
    - It allows me to compare changes over two periods of time.
    - It displays both the proportions (points) and the rate change between them (lines) in a way that's immediately easy to understand.
- Key design decisions:
    - I chose to bundle more transportation options into the "Other" category. Now that we've determined statistical significance, I thought that fewer lines on the graph would allow me to make the main point clear.
    - The rideshare label, points, and line are dark teal, while the rest of the categories are shades of gray. This allows the viewer to tell the difference between the other categories while drawing the eye right to the rideshare data I want them to zero in on.
    - I chose to graph proportions instead of absolute counts of weighted responses because of the different samples sizes from year to year.

**Key Findings:**
- Rideshare usage has increased between 2016 and 2017, becoming the number one transportation method for reaching SFO.

### Income Level Analysis (Stacked 100% Bar Chart)

**Design Choices:**
- Rationale for using a 100% stacked bar chart
- How the visualization effectively shows income-based patterns
- Design decisions that enhance readability

### Travel Purpose Analysis (Clustered Bar Chart)

**Design Choices:**
- Why a clustered bar chart was chosen
- How the design facilitates comparison between business and non-business travelers
- Key visual elements that highlight important patterns
