# SFO Transportation Trends Analysis

## Project Background
This project analyzes how different types of travelers get to and from San Francisco International Airport (SFO). Understanding these transportation patterns helps inform decisions about resource allocation, partnerships, and infrastructure planning. This information is crucial because it impacts airport revenue, customer satisfaction, and future development needs.

Important terms:
- Business travelers: Passengers traveling primarily for work
- Leisure travelers: Passengers traveling primarily for personal reasons
- Rideshare services: Transportation services like Uber and Lyft
- Traditional options: Conventional transportation including taxis, shuttles, and personal vehicles

## Executive Summary
Based on SFO customer survey data from 2016-2017, I've identified significant changes in how passengers access the airport. The analysis reveals a clear shift toward rideshare services, especially among business and higher-income travelers. This change suggests a fundamental transformation in airport transportation preferences that requires strategic adaptation in services and infrastructure.
