# SFO Transportation Data Visualization [WIP]

This project addresses a key business problem for San Francisco International Airport (SFO): understanding and optimizing transportation patterns to enhance traveler satisfaction. By analyzing transportation data, the project identifies trends and highlights behavioral differences between traveler segments.

## Business Problem
SFO seeks to adapt to changing transportation preferences and traveler behavior. Key challenges include:
- Increasing reliance on rideshare services year over year.
- Understanding how transportation preferences differ across income levels and traveler types (business vs. non-business).
- Balancing improvements to rideshare services with support for other transportation options to serve all traveler segments effectively.

## Proposed Solution
This project delivers:
- **Analysis**: A comprehensive exploration of transportation patterns at SFO, including year-over-year trends and traveler segment behavior.
- **Visualizations**: Excel-based visualizations for a consulting presentation to clearly communicate findings and insights.
- **Recommendations**: [WIP]

## Final Visualizations

### Key Findings
- Rideshare app usage has increased year over year among all travelers at SFO.
- Higher-income travelers are more likely to use rideshare apps to reach the airport.
- Business travelers rely more heavily on rideshare options compared to non-business travelers.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory analysis of transportation trends, preferences, and traveler behaviors.
- **Excel Visualizations**: Static visualizations styled to reflect professional consulting deliverables, presenting year-over-year trends, income-level comparisons, and differences between business and non-business travelers.
- **Recommendations** [WIP]

## Data Source
- The dataset includes individual, anonymized survey responses related to customer experience at SFO.
