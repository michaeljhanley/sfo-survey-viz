# SFO Transportation Data Visualization

This project addresses a key business problem for San Francisco International Airport (SFO): understanding and optimizing transportation patterns to enhance traveler satisfaction. By analyzing transportation data, the project identifies trends and highlights behavioral differences between traveler segments.

## Business Problem
In this scenario, SFO seeks to adapt to changing transportation preferences and traveler behavior. Key challenges include:
- Increasing reliance on rideshare services year over year.
- Understanding how transportation preferences differ across income levels and traveler types (business vs. non-business).
- Balancing improvements to rideshare services with support for other transportation options to serve all traveler segments effectively.

## Final Visualizations

### Key Findings
- Rideshare app usage has increased year over year among all travelers at SFO.
- Higher-income travelers are more likely to use rideshare apps to reach the airport.
- Business travelers rely more heavily on rideshare options compared to non-business travelers.

## Proposed Solution
This project delivers:
- **Analysis**: A comprehensive exploration of transportation patterns at SFO, including year-over-year trends and traveler segment behavior.
- **Visualizations**: Excel-based static visualizations styled to reflect professional consulting deliverables. These present year-over-year trends, income-level comparisons, and differences between business and non-business travelers.
- **Recommendations**:
     - Enhance rideshare partnerships
     - Target marketing campaigns
     - Support other transportation options
